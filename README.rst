Documentation for Polaric Server project
========================================

This is the repository for technical documentation of Polaric Server. 
The docs is produced using Sphinx and published using Read The Docs. 

It is available at:

https://polaricserver.readthedocs.io

And (redirect) from: 

https://aprs.no/polaricserver

Most of the earlier Dokuwiki based doc has now beenb moved over and updated. More is underway. Still, it is considerable task to document everything well. User documentation would be nice but is not currently part of this. 

Feedback is welcome! Contributions are welcome!
