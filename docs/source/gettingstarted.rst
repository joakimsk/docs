Getting started
***************

This is a guide how to get an instance up and running with a very basic configuration rather quickly. *Polaric Server* (*aprsd*) runs on a fairly standard JVM platform and the client (*webapp2*) runs on a fairly standard webserver (Apache 2 is currently supported). Deb packages are available to allow easy installation on several Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Armbian, etc. 

In addition to standard PCs it has been reported to work on smaller devices like the Raspberry PI, the Microsat Ulari Duo 2, etc.. See an article on how to run it on the Ulari `here <http://hamlabs.no/2022/03/27/polaric-server-runs-well-on-ulari/>`_:
